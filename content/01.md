My journey began around 2019, when I was preparing for university. I remember, buying the first *"throwaway"* laptop of mine (which later turned about to be one of my faviourite machines when travelling, but more on that on an other time) to experience the joy of Linux.

I installed Ubuntu (at the time probably 18 LTS) on it and started my journey. If I am not mistaken one of the main selling points for me was that Linux does not have any viruses for desktop users and it is just so customizable. I actually loved the idea, because due to sailing the seas, I did manage to get myself infected in the past, only my Eset antivirus preventing total annihilation from a ransomware...

Many years later, I realize that just how naive we are were and still are, thinking that a basic Ubuntu installation is actually secure, and I do not mean Ubuntu specifically (Canonical does actually some really sane defaults), but things that most of us miss.

Today I use Linux for everything, including gaming, development, making calls, editing text or media and I even host my own public-facing server.

In this series of scratching my own thoughts on this virtual piece of paper I would like to invite you to explore the following security plot-holes in the story of using desktop Linux:

- Booting securely
- Separating users' and the system's data
- Securing system services
- Using multifactor authentication
- Securing our browser
- Encryption without passwords
- Sandboxing our programs and systems
